# Heart Disease Prediction using Decision Tree & Random Forest
Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of heart disease using machine learning algorithms â€” Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classifier.
The dataset (heart.csv) contains patient health records, and the models aim to classify patients as having heart disease or no heart disease.

The project uses GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning, evaluates performance using ROC-AUC score, confusion matrix, and classification report, and visualizes the models for better interpretability.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
File: heart.csv

Source: Kaggle - Heart Disease UCI Dataset

Description: The dataset contains features like age, cholesterol, blood pressure, heart rate, etc.
